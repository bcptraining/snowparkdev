## 🟡 STATUS — Partially Active

**Last updated: August 26, 2025**

This repository now contains **two Snowpark applications**, each with distinct scopes and development statuses:

| App Name               | Purpose                                  | Status     | Notes                                                                 |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `first_snowpark_project` | DAG-based Snowpark app using legacy SDK | 🔴 Paused   | Development halted due to SDK conflicts between `snowflake.core` and `snowflake.snowpark`. |
| `DE_PROJECT_1`         | Data engineering pipeline (Snowpark Core) | 🟢 Active   | Focused on clean ingestion, transformation, and deployment of tabular data. |

### 🔴 `first_snowpark_project`

This app was designed to explore DAG-style orchestration using Snowflake’s Python SDKs. While the DAG itself was successfully deployed, execution failed due to incompatibilities between the legacy `snowflake.snowpark` and the newer `snowflake.core` SDK. Key blockers included:

- Conflicting `Session` class implementations  
- Incompatible method signatures (e.g., `StoredProcedureCall(handler=...)`)  
- Lack of feature parity between SDKs  

Development is paused until the Core SDK matures enough to fully replace the legacy Snowpark SDK.

### 🟢 `DE_PROJECT_1`

This new app focuses on **data engineering workflows** using Snowpark and GitHub Actions. It includes:

- Clean ingestion of CSV data  
- Transformation using Pandas + Snowpark  
- Deployment of functions, procedures, and tables via CI/CD  

The app is actively maintained and serves as a reference for Snowflake-native data engineering pipelines.



## ✅ Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- A Snowflake trial account with **ORGADMIN** access
- A GitHub account with access to the target repository
- GitHub Codespaces enabled (optional, for cloud-based dev)
- Python 3.11 and Conda (if developing locally)
- Basic familiarity with Git workflows and CI/CD concepts

---

## ❄️ Snowflake Connection Overview

This project connects to Snowflake in two main contexts: during local development (via Codespaces) and during automated deployment (via GitHub Actions).

---

### 🧑‍💻 Local Development (Codespaces)

In Codespaces, the connection to Snowflake is established when you run setup scripts or interact with Snowflake manually. Specifically:

- **File:** `setup.sh`

  - Loads environment variables from `.env` and uses the **Snowflake CLI** to upload files to a Snowflake stage.
  - Relies on secrets defined in Codespaces to authenticate.

- **File:** `process_stock_sales_data.py`
  - Uses **Snowpark for Python** to connect to Snowflake, read a CSV file, transform the data, and write to a table.
  - Connection is configured via `Session.builder.config(...)`, pulling credentials from environment variables.

> 📍 Connection is triggered when you run the setup script or execute the data transformation script manually.

---

### 🤖 CI/CD Workflows (GitHub Actions)

In GitHub Actions, the connection to Snowflake happens during automated deployment workflows:

- **File:** `.github/workflows/build_and_deploy_*.yml`

  - Loads secrets from GitHub Actions and invokes the deployment script.

- **File:** `deploy_snowflake_app.py`
  - Reads the `snowflake.yml` manifest and generates a `.toml` file that defines the deployment configuration.
  - This `.toml` file is used by the **Snowflake CLI** to deploy stored procedures, functions, and other objects.
  - Authentication is handled via secrets injected into the workflow environment.

> 📍 Connection is triggered automatically when a workflow runs (e.g., on merge or pull request).

---

## 🗂️ What’s the `.toml` File?

The `.toml` file is a structured configuration file generated during deployment. It contains metadata about:

- The target Snowflake account and role  
- The database and schema  
- The objects to deploy (e.g., functions, procedures)  
- Source paths and build settings  

This file acts as an intermediary between your `snowflake.yml` manifest and the Snowflake CLI, enabling reproducible and declarative deployments.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project does **not** use `.snowflake/config.toml`.  
> That file is typically used by the Snowflake CLI for manual workflows, but it is **ignored** here.  
> All configuration is generated dynamically by `deploy_snowflake_app.py`, so you can safely delete or ignore `.snowflake/config.toml`.

The generated `.toml` file lives temporarily during the deployment process and reflects the contents of `snowflake.yml` combined with secrets injected into the environment. It ensures that the Snowflake CLI receives all necessary context without relying on persistent config files.


### 🔐 Authentication Summary

| Context        | Tool/Method Used        | Secrets Source         |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Codespaces     | Snowflake CLI, Snowpark | `.env` from Codespaces |
| GitHub Actions | Snowflake CLI, Snowpark | GitHub Actions Secrets |

---

> 💡 **Tip**: To trace the connection logic, look for:
>
> - `Session.builder.config(...)` in Python files
> - `snowflake deploy` commands in scripts
> - CLI commands like `snowflake stage put` in `setup.sh`
> - `.toml` generation logic in `deploy_snowflake_app.py`


## 🚀 Environment Promotion via GitHub Workflows

This project uses GitHub Actions to automate deployment of the Snowflake app across environments: **Dev → QA → Prod**. Each stage of promotion is triggered by Git activity — such as merges and pull requests — and handled by a dedicated workflow file.

## 🏗️ Infrastructure Setup

This project has a requirement of Snowflake infrastructure to be setup. The account topology used is to have a Snowflake account per environment.

### 🧭 Create Environment Accounts in Snowflake

To set up separate Snowflake accounts for each environment (`DEV_ACCT`, `QA_ACCT`, `PROD_ACCT`), follow these steps:

1. **Sign in to your Snowflake trial account**.
2. **Switch to the `ORGADMIN` role** (required for account creation).
3. **Run the script below**, substituting your own email addresses and secure passwords.

```sql
-- Use the ORGADMIN role
USE ROLE ORGADMIN;

-- Create DEV environment account
CREATE ACCOUNT DEV_ACCT
  ADMIN_NAME = 'dev_admin'
  ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'YourSecurePassword123!'
  EMAIL = 'dev_admin@example.com'
  MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD = TRUE
  EDITION = 'STANDARD';

-- Create QA environment account
CREATE ACCOUNT QA_ACCT
  ADMIN_NAME = 'qa_admin'
  ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'YourSecurePassword123!'
  EMAIL = 'qa_admin@example.com'
  MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD = TRUE
  EDITION = 'STANDARD';

-- Create PROD environment account
CREATE ACCOUNT PROD_ACCT
  ADMIN_NAME = 'prod_admin'
  ADMIN_PASSWORD = 'YourSecurePassword123!'
  EMAIL = 'prod_admin@example.com'
  MUST_CHANGE_PASSWORD = TRUE
  EDITION = 'STANDARD';
```

### Configure Each Environment

```sql
-- Create core database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS DEMO_DB;
USE DATABASE DEMO_DB;

-- Create warehouse if needed (you will need it if your environment snowflake accounts are STANDARD)
CREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS COMPUTE_WH
WITH WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'XSMALL'
AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;

-- Grant permissions to create objects in DEMO_DB.PUBLIC
GRANT CREATE STAGE, CREATE FUNCTION, CREATE PROCEDURE ON SCHEMA DEMO_DB.PUBLIC TO ROLE SYSADMIN;
```

## 🔧 GitHub Repository & Branching

**Repository:**  
🔗 [bcptraining/snowparkdev](https://github.com/bcptraining/snowparkdev)

**Branching Strategy:**

- 🛠 **Feature Branch**: `devenv` (or any custom name)
- 🌱 **Environment Branches**:
  - `dev`: Development environment
  - `qa`: QA/Staging environment
  - `prod`: Production environment

Each branch maps directly to a Snowflake environment and is used to trigger environment-specific deployment workflows.

---

## 🔐 Secrets Configuration

To enable both GitHub Codespaces and GitHub Actions to interact with Snowflake securely, you’ll need to define the following secrets in **two places**:

### ✅ Required Secrets

| Secret Name           | Purpose                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT`   | Snowflake account identifier          |
| `SNOWFLAKE_USER`      | Username for Snowflake authentication |
| `SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD`  | Password for Snowflake authentication |
| `SNOWFLAKE_ROLE`      | Role used for executing queries       |
| `SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE` | Warehouse used for compute            |
| `SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE`  | Target database                       |
| `SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA`    | Target schema                         |

### 🧑‍💻 Define in Codespaces

Go to your repository → **Codespaces** → **Secrets** and add each of the above secrets.

### 🤖 Define in GitHub Actions

Go to your repository → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **New repository secret**, and add the same secrets.

> 💡 **Why define secrets in both places?**
>
> GitHub **Codespaces** and **Actions** run in separate environments:
>
> - **Codespaces** uses secrets during interactive development (e.g., running setup scripts, testing locally).
> - **Actions** uses secrets during automated CI/CD workflows (e.g., deploying to Snowflake).
>
> Even though the variable names are the same, they must be defined **independently** in each context to ensure both environments have access to the credentials they need.

---

## 🧪 Development Environment (Codespaces)

This project uses **GitHub Codespaces** for cloud-based development, but it can also run locally or in Docker.

### ⚙️ Development Container Setup

The container is defined in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`, which uses a **Python 3.11 base image** and runs `setup.sh` after creation. The setup script:

- 🐍 Initializes Conda and creates `py311_env` from `environment.yml`
- 📦 Installs `pipx` and globally installs the **Snowflake CLI**
- 🔐 Loads environment variables from `.env`
- 📁 Uploads a local data file to a Snowflake stage using the CLI
- 🛠️ Updates the shell `PATH` to ensure CLI tools are accessible

> 💡 Tip: You can replicate this setup locally by running `setup.sh` inside a Python 3.11 Conda environment.

### 🔄 Promotion Flow Overview

| GitHub Branch Activity       | Triggered Workflow File     | Target Environment |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Pull request `feat`→ `dev`   | `build_and_deploy_dev.yml`  | Development        |
| Pull request `dev` → `qa`    | `build_and_deploy_qa.yml`   | QA / Staging       |
| Pull request `qa` → `main`   | `build_and_deploy_prod.yml` | Production         |

This setup ensures:

- **Explicit control** over promotions via pull requests
- **Automated deployment** to the correct Snowflake environment
- **Environment isolation** through scoped configs and secrets

## 📦 Scope of Snowpark Objects to Be Deployed

This example CI/CD pipeline deploys the following Snowpark objects into the `DEMO_DB.PUBLIC` schema:

### 🔧 Objects Deployed

- **Python Function**
  - `HELLO_FUNCTION`: Greets a user by name.
- **Python Procedures**
  - `HELLO_PROCEDURE2`: Wraps the greeting logic as a procedure.
  - `TEST_PROCEDURE`: A second demo procedure.
- **Table**
  - `STOCK_VALUE_SUMMARY`: Stores transformed CSV data.

> 🛠️ A one-time data transformation step processes a CSV file and populates the `STOCK_VALUE_SUMMARY` table. This is **not** a recurring pipeline.

---

### 🗂️ Code Structure & Deployment Details

All deployable code lives in the `app/` folder within the `first_snowpark_project` directory.

#### 📁 Folder Breakdown

- **Functions & Procedures**

  - Located in:
    - `app/python/functions/`
    - `app/python/procedures/`
  - Registered via `snowflake.yml`.

- **Data Transformation Script**

  - `app/python/process_stock_sales_data.py`:  
    A standalone script that:
    - Reads a CSV file
    - Cleans and summarizes it using **Pandas** and **Snowpark**
    - Writes the result to a Snowflake table  
      This demonstrates a **script-driven pipeline**, not a function or procedure.

- **Data Files**
  - `app/data/`:  
    Contains:
    - The original CSV file
    - A cleaned version generated during preprocessing

| Data Transformation | N/A                                 | Standalone script         | `app/python/process_stock_sales_data.py` |
| CSV Data Files      | N/A                                 | Input/output for pipeline | `app/data/`                              |

---

### 🧾 `snowflake.yml` Configuration

The `snowflake.yml` file acts as a manifest for the Snowflake CLI, defining how Snowpark objects are registered and deployed.

#### 📌 Example: `snowflake.yml`

```yaml
version: 1.0

functions:
  - name: HELLO_FUNCTION
    file: app/python/functions/hello_function.py
    handler: hello_function.handler
    language: python
    runtime: 3.11
    packages:
      - snowflake-snowpark-python

procedures:
  - name: HELLO_PROCEDURE2
    file: app/python/procedures/hello_procedure2.py
    handler: hello_procedure.handler
    language: python
    runtime: 3.11
    packages:
      - snowflake-snowpark-python

  - name: TEST_PROCEDURE
    file: app/python/procedures/test_procedure.py

## ⚙️ Workflow Breakdown

Each workflow file in `.github/workflows/` defines a CI/CD pipeline tailored to its environment:

### `build_and_deploy_dev.yml`

- **Triggered by**: Pushes or merges to `dev`
- **Purpose**: Deploys feature branch changes into the dev environment
- **Uses**: Dev-specific Snowflake role, warehouse, and database

### `build_and_deploy_qa.yml`

- **Triggered by**: Pull request from `dev` to `qa`
- **Purpose**: Promotes tested code to QA for validation
- **Uses**: QA-specific Snowflake configuration

### `build_and_deploy_prod.yml`

- **Triggered by**: Pull request from `qa` to `main`
- **Purpose**: Final promotion to production
- **Uses**: Production Snowflake credentials and settings

Each workflow performs the following steps:

1. Sets up Python and dependencies
2. Loads environment secrets from GitHub
3. Runs `deploy_snowflake_app.py` with the appropriate project directory
4. Validates and deploys the app to Snowflake

> 📄 **About `deploy_snowflake_app.py`**  
> This script serves as the deployment orchestrator for Snowpark applications. It reads the `snowflake.yml` manifest, applies environment-specific configurations, and invokes the Snowflake CLI to register functions, procedures, and other objects.  
> It ensures that only the correct code is deployed to the appropriate Snowflake environment, based on the current GitHub branch and secrets.

---

This structure ensures a clean, auditable, and automated path from feature development to production deployment.
